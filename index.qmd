# Trust in science

## Public trust of science

::: {.incremental}
- Good news! Australians view science favourably
- Generally, majority of Australians trust science and scientists [@tranter_2023;@3mstateofscience_2022]
- Often, scientists are trusted more than other officials [@martin_2022;@pewresearchcenter_2022a;@3mstateofscience_2022]
- Portion of the public are distrustful of science [@mede_2020]
- Public may be vulnerable to misinformation about specific sciences [@rutjens_2021]
:::

## Growing concerns

::: {.incremental}
> "Misinformation about climate science ... has sowed uncertainty, and impeded [the public's] recognition of risk" [@intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechange_2022, Chapter 12]

> "Misinformation costs lives. Without the appropriate trust and correct information, diagnostic tests go unused, immunization campaigns ... will not meet their targets, and the virus will continue to thrive." [@worldhealthorganization_2020]

> "In effect, disinformation can affect the full range of human rights by disrupting people's ability to make informed decisions about policies relating to, for example, the environment, crime, migration and education, among other issues of public interest and concern." [@secretary-generaltounitednationsgeneralassembly_2022, p. 3]

## What is anti-science?

> **Anti-science** are relatively-enduring claims of an event, object, process, person, or group of people that is inconsistent with scientific consensus or methods

## Anti-science claims

- Public encounter science through the simplified claims of science, not multi-page papers
- E.g., headlines, social media posts
- Anti-science status of claims can be difficult to verify (truth is not always clear)
- Anti-science claims may be imbued with an unfalsifiable claim or demand

## Anti-science claims about climate change

![Taxonomy of claims made by science contrarians [@coan_2021]](assets/cook_2021-climate-scepticism.webp){height="1000" fig-align="center"}


## What are some anti-science claims about your own field?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Activity: What are some anti-science claims about your own field?

Brainstorm some examples of anti-science claims about your own field, in section 1.1 of the handout.

It could be broad ("climate change impacts are overstated") or specific ("The World Economic Forum proposed 15-minute cities to begin a Great Reset by climate-crazed tyrants and conspiracies").

Some questions to reflect on:

- Have you encountered misconceptions about your field in conversations (chatting with stakeholders, dinner with family)?
- What are some common misconceptions of your field shared on social media or the news?
- When aren't facts enough to convince people?
- When do conversations about your science become heated?
:::

# The psychological roots of anti-science

## The foundations of anti-science claims

> **Mental models** are a cognitive representation of the elements and the causal relations (or patterns) of a world.

- Mental models can be chosen to generate or explain anti-science claims
- Mental models can be inconsistent and incomplete
```{mermaid}
%%| mermaid-format: svg
%%| fig-height: 600px
flowchart TD
  A(<p><b>Claim</b>\nFacts, observations, or predictions</p>)
  B(<p><b>Mental model</b>\nRepresentation of the system and its causes</p>)
  A <---> B
```

## Identifying mental models

- Mental models can be identified via verbal protocol (e.g., asking people 'why?')
- E.g., we explored the psychological foundations of Australian's climate change views [@andreotta_2022]
- 435 Australians ranked 30 climate change claims (derived from Twitter) according to congruence with point of view
- For statements ranked most similar to their point of view, participants were asked for justification
- We found three styles of sorting, reflective of 'Acceptors', 'Fencesitters', and 'Sceptics' profiles

. . .

```{mermaid}
%%| mermaid-format: svg
%%| fig-width: 1300px
flowchart TD
  A("<p><b>Claim</b>\n&ldquo;Scientists should stop falsely claiming that climate change is a settled science&rdquo;</p>")
  B("<p><b>Mental model</b>\n&ldquo;Only some scientists are saying this. Listen to all - they are not all singing from the same hymn book&rdquo;</p>")
  A <---> B
```

## Your turn!

::: {.callout-tip}
## Activity: The foundations of mental models

1. Choose one of the following claims that you generally agree with (or think of your own):

- "Pressing coastal and marine issues, such as climate change, ... are, in many ways, governance problems."
- "It is critical to develop an understanding of the ocean's biophysical limits"
- "Marine ecosystems cannot support ongoing growth without transformational change"

Write down your chosen claim in section 2.1 of the handout.

2. Ask yourself "why do I believe this?" and write down your response in section 2.2 of the handout.
3. Repeat step 2 and 3 with your new response in section 2.2 of the handout. Stop once you feel you are going around in circles, or reach something that just "is".

## The foundations of mental models

```{mermaid}
%%| mermaid-format: svg
%%| fig-height: 700px
flowchart TD
  A(<p><b>Claim</b>\nFacts, observations, or predictions</p>)
  B(<p><b>Mental model</b>\nRepresentation of the system and its causes</p>)
  C(<p><b>Worldview</b>\nFundamental understandings of the world</p>)
  C ---> A ---> C
  A <---> B <---> C
```

. . .

- Based on Causal Layered Analysis [@inayatullah2004]
- Fundamental understandings shape what we say (claim) and how we think (mental model)
- Culturally transmitted understandings shaped by individual experience [@koltko-rivera_2004]
- E.g., What is human nature? What is knowledge? What is 'right' and 'wrong'? What is an ideal world?

## The nature of truth

> Fundamental understandings of the world, society, and human nature

- Cultural and environmental worldviews
- Political ideology
- Conspiracist worldviews
- The nature of knowledge

## Cultural worldviews

> Fundamental understandings on the structure of society

- Worldviews can be classified on two dimensions [@kahan_2007; @price2014; @hornsey_2021; @douglas_1983]
  1. **Individualism-Communitarian**: From self-reliance and competition to collective identity and strong social bonds
  2. **Hierarchist-Egalitarian**: From role- or class-based social stratification to role inclusivity 
- Motivates rejection of views that threaten preferred way of life

}
```

## Environmental worldviews

> Fundamental understandings on the interaction between society and environment

- Understandings of society and nature are interlinked [@price2014]
- The Individualism-Communitarian dimension is particularly relevant [@price2014; @kahan_2007]

. . .

}
```

. . .

- Climate change Acceptors and Sceptics differ in their worldviews of nature [@andreotta_2022; @price2014]
- Shapes mental models of climate change
- Shapes aversion to proposed mitigation [@campbell_2014] 

## Political ideology

- The Individualism-Communitarian dimension of worldviews reflects Western left-right ideology
- American conservative think tanks and media disseminate climate change scpeticism [@jacques_2008; @mccright_2010]
- In America and Australia, political affiliation and ideology are associated with climate change scepticism [@andreotta_2022;@hornsey2018]
- Not true for all nations [@hornsey2018]

## Conspiracist worldviews

> Powerful, malevolent groups coordinate in secret to conduct deceive the public

- Routinely related to antivaccination views [@lewandowsky2013a; @hornsey_2018]
- Suspicion of 'unnatural' produce and technology, like genetically modified food, labgrown meat, and 5G safety [@lewandowsky2013a; @jolley_2020; @hornsey_2020]
- Mixed evidence that conspiracist worldviews relate to climate change scepticisms [@andreotta_2022;@lewandowsky2020;@hornsey2018]

. . .

- Climate change conspiracies are used to undermine scientific consensus [@lewandowsky2020;@andreotta_2022]
- Two paths:
  1. Conspiracist worldview
  2. Worldviews and ideology

## The nature of knowledge

> What is knowledge and where does it come from?

- How can we know?
- Who are trusted sources of knowledge?
- Scientists might disagree about particularly methods or statistics
- Indigenous knowledge systems
- Science can legitimise existing power structures, have vested interests, etc.

. . .

- Science-related populism casts scientists and their methods as nefarious elite [@mede_2020;@mede_2022]
- Do scientists have the right to declare what is known?
- Do scientists have the right to make their own research agendas and curtail problematic fields?
- Who should scientists be accountable to?

## The nature of goodness

> Fundamental understandings of what is right and wrong

- Moral understanding (e.g., preventing harm) and justice
- E.g., Vaccination 'rejectors' value sanctity and liberty more than others [@rossen_2019]
- What is harm and who can be harmed? The environment? The economy? Future generations? Technological growth?
- Values [@schwartz2012]
  1. Openness to change (self-direction versus tradition and conformity)
  2. Self-transcendence (benevolence versus achievement and power)
- Worldviews and ideologies are often imbued with sense of right versus wrong

```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Activity: The underpinnings of anti-science 

Choose an anti-science claim from section 1.1 of your handout. Reflect on the worldviews of someone who might endorse your chosen anti-science claim. Write down these in section 1.3. Some prompts:

1. Is this person likely to see the world in a particular way?
2. Is this person likely to see knowledge in a particular way?
3. To this person, could adherence to your chosen anti-science claim add good (or reduce bad) in the world?
:::

## The needs underpinning anti-science

- Adopting anti-science views can satisfy psychological needs [@douglas_2017; @hornsey_2020]
- Psychological needs can shape the logic between layers

- Epistemic needs
  * Need for cognitive consistency
  * Uncertainty bias
  * Proportionality bias

. . .

- Existential needs (e.g., phobias, protect way of life)

. . . 

- Social needs
  * Personal identity expression (distinctiveness)
  * Social identity expression (internalise and exemplify attitudes and values of groups)

. . .

- Material needs (e.g., vested interests)

## Climate science communication

- Australian's climate change views fall into one of three profiles: Acceptors, Fencesitters, and Sceptics [@andreotta_2022]
- Each profile contained some misunderstanding of science

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
**Profile:** Acceptors

**The anti-science:** Overconfidence in the effectiveness of 'green' climate change mitigation (e.g., recycling)

**The foundation:** Concern for environmental harms, worldviews and ideology encourages belief in anthropogenic climate change

**The recommendation:** Leverage need for cognitive consistency 

:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

**Profile:** Fencesitters

**The anti-science:** On average, do not perceive climate change as harmful.

**The foundation:** Some harbour conspiracist worldviews, some are disengaged.

**The recommendation:** Emphasise threat of disinformation, encourage critical reflection.

**Profile:** Sceptics

**The anti-science:** Do not perceive climate change as harmful or anthropogenic.

**The foundation:** Conservative ideology, solution aversion.

**The recommendation:** Leverage social needs by using messages from conservative sources or stories from former climate change deniers. Leverage need for cognitive consistency to emphasise belief in empiricism and science.

- Scientific claims follow the same structure, needs and assumptions may differ
- E.g., epistemic needs and understandings drive scientists to explain observations

## What about you?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Activity: Your psychological roots

Reflect on the science claim you chose in an earlier activity, noting your thoughts in sections 2.3 to 2.5

1. Can you identify the worldviews that might shape this claim?
2. Can you identify the psychological needs that might drive belief in this claim?

Consider:

- What would it take to change your mind?
- Do you feel emotionally connected to this statement?
- Do you feel the world would be worse off if nobody believed this claim?
- If you no longer believed this claim, would you feel like a different person?
- Would your family, friends, and colleagues agree with this statement? Would they think less of you if you no longer agreed with this claim?
:::

## Summary

- Scientists are often trusted authorities, giving us unique power to combat disinformation/misinformation
- Anti-science (and science) belief can be underpinned by fundamental understandings and deep assumptions about the world
- Fundamental understandings privilege some explanations over others to satisfy psychological needs
- Psychological needs can also encourage belief change
- Communication can be more effective when tailored to satisfy psychological needs and when messages are compatible with worldviews

## Thank you
